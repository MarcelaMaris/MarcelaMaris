## 🚀 About Me

I’m a **data-driven professional** with a strong foundation in **Mathematics** (University of São Paulo – USP, one of the top universities in Latin America).  
My career has been shaped by **analytical thinking**, **problem-solving**, and managing complex projects, which naturally led me to transition into **Data Analytics**.  
I’m motivated by the challenge of transforming data into meaningful insights that support smarter decisions.

For over **15 years**, I worked in the **publishing industry**, leading large-scale educational projects in Mathematics and Physics. This involved **data tracking**, **deadline management**, **stakeholder communication**, **quality assurance**, and **market research with teachers and students**—experiences that sharpened my analytical mindset and ability to work with diverse datasets and perspectives.

After relocating to **London**, I invested in building technical skills to complement this background.  
I completed the **Meta Data Analytics Certificate** and the **TripleTen Data Analytics Bootcamp**, gaining hands-on experience with **SQL**, **Python**, **Excel**, **statistics**, **hypothesis testing**, **dashboards**, and **business-oriented analytics projects**.

I’m eager to contribute to organisations that value **data-driven decision-making**, while continuously growing as a data professional and supporting impactful business outcomes.  
I’m open to opportunities in **London (on-site or hybrid)** as well as **remote collaborations worldwide**.
